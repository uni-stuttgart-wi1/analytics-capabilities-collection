"We need to extract, integrate and visualize data to get insights with high timeliness, high completeness, and without violating privacy in order to support real time monitoring of the fleet under consideration of the idiosyncratic requirements of our consumer-oriented fleet management environment (high business specificity).","Using a decentralized architecture with an event-log as a middleware., Using a stream coordinator and a stream analytics tool for stream processing."
"We need to extract, integrate and transform data to get insights with high accuracy, high completeness, and high consistency in order to find root causes of issues with vehicles in an environment with machineoriented systems and transactional systems under consideration of the highly specific environment.","Using a decentralized architecture with an event-log as a middleware., Using a stream coordinator and a stream analytics tool for stream processing."
"We need to extract, store, integrate, transform, and visualize data to get insights with high accuracy, high accessibility, high completeness, and high consistency in order to control costs at partner garages in an environment with organizational distributed systems and high governance restrictions.","Using a decentralized architecture with an event-log as a middleware., Using a stream coordinator and a stream analytics tool for stream processing."
"We need to extract, integrate, and visualize data to get insights with high timeliness, medium accuracy, and consistence, and high privacy in order to identify major trends and issues in the port traffic in an environment with various heterogeneous and distributed IoT systems.","Using a stream processing tool for complex event processing"
"We need to extract, store, integrate, transform data to get insights with high accuracy and high completeness, and high consistence to create overarching traffic reports in an environment with a medium technical and organizational reach, high agility in source systems and restrictive governance rules.","Establish a virtual data warehouse that integrates data from various departments."
